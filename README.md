# Online Meeting Assistant (OMA)  

**OMA** is a hybrid software-hardware solution designed to optimize the online meeting experience. It enhances user engagement and comfort through real-time insights into facial expressions, environmental conditions, and proximity.  

## Features  
- **Facial Emotion Recognition**: Monitors user engagement and professionalism during meetings.  
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Tracks temperature, humidity, light, and proximity for optimal comfort.  
- **Proximity Alerts**: Ensures proper camera framing and audio quality.  
- **Actionable Insights**: Provides real-time feedback to help users improve their meeting setup.  

## Inspiration  
In a hybrid society, online meetings occur in various settings—homes, cafés, or outdoors. OMA ensures users can present themselves professionally and comfortably, regardless of their environment.  

## How It Works  
- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi connected to an Arduino with sensors for humidity, temperature, light, and proximity.  
- **Software**: A locally deployed Facial Emotion Recognition model with Python scripts for data acquisition and analysis.  
- **Communication**: MQTT for seamless interaction between hardware and software components.  

## Challenges  
- Hardware-software compatibility required troubleshooting and custom solutions.  
- Outdated drivers for sensors posed integration challenges with the latest Raspberry Pi OS.  

## Accomplishments  
- Integrated hardware and software into a seamless user experience.  
- Deployed a lightweight, real-time Facial Emotion Recognition model.  
- Addressed real-world challenges faced by remote workers.  

## What We Learned  
- The importance of thorough hardware-software compatibility research.  
- Effective troubleshooting for hardware integration issues.  

## Future Plans  
- **Advanced Analytics**: Include focus and fatigue tracking during meetings.  
- **AI-Driven Suggestions**: Proactive tips for lighting, seating, and more based on historical data.  
- **Enhanced UI**: Intuitive interface for actionable insights and analytics.  
- **Customizability**: Tailor feedback to user-specific needs and preferences.
